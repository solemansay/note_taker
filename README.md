  ## Description 

  I built this app to take notes and for the notes to be saved on an api that is being dynamically created as the user inputs their desired note into the form. The app uses a combination of front and back end development working together to save, append and delete notes.  

  AS A user I want an app that will allow me to organize my day <br>
  GIVEN a start screen <br>
  WHEN I click get started <br>
  THEN I am presented with a form to input a title and a note <br>
  WHEN I save a note <br>
  THEN the note is saved to the left of the screen until deleted <br>
  WHEN the delete button is pressed <br>
  THEN the note is deleted from the screen <br>

  <img src= "assets/homeScreen.png" alt = "Home screen">

  Once all of the fields are filled out, the user can save their note to be viewed later and or deleted forever from both the db.json file and left window containing the saved notes.
